L204 cross section refers to the production probability which is of course the same regardless of the decay channel. Branching fraction refers to the fraction of events decaying a certain way… so
Ois the large difference in branching fraction that accounts for the different in statistics. 

L206— again the cross section is the same.

^^^ but different decay channels can have different production cross sections...? - am I quoting these cross sections incorrectly? (should I be quoting the branching fractions)

L226 poor sentence, rewrite. 

^^^ not entirely sure why (is it the use of ‘such?’ Or ‘sensitive to tWZ?’ or something else)


L535 working point is jargon, you can just simply explain that this is a certain algorithm with a certain cut 

^^^ should I not just define what a wp is? I use WP quite a lot, for example in optimisation of the btag wps (event selection)

L646 broken ref to table. 

^^^ this was supposed to refer to the triggers used, do I need to include a section describing the triggers used in data and MC?  


L844 mention why you only show the ttZ CR for this comparison of data and simulation. 

^^^ I’m not entirely sure the reason why we are able to do this... the alternative ttbar sample and the ttz sample use different event generators and parton showers
