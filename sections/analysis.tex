\subsection{Data Samples}
Brief overview of Full Run 2 and where the data comes from and what time period.\\\\
Luminosity of full run 2. 

\subsection{Monte Carlo Samples}
Signal and Background samples. Choice of cuts at ntuple level. Specifically why each background is chosen (and why others excluded) $\rightarrow$ e.g. talk about branching fractions, cross sections, topology. How are these backgrounds passing our event selection (e.g. ttz $\rightarrow$ b can be lost/untagged/mis-id'ed) $\rightarrow$ provide an explanation for each background.\\\\
Details of each sample (event generator, parton shower).


The following background processes are considered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathbf{t \bar{t} Z}$: $t \bar{t} $  with an associated $Z$-boson, in the tetralepton final state. Therefore, both top-quarks decay leptonically (e.g. $t \rightarrow W^+ b \rightarrow \ell^+ \nu b$) and of these top-quarks emits a $Z$-boson which decays leptonically ($Z \rightarrow \ell^\pm \ell^\mp$ (OSSF lepton pair) ). This results in a final state with 4 leptons and 2 b-quarks.
	\item $\mathbf{ZZ}$: Diboson production with a tetralepton final state, therefore both $Z$-bosons decay leptonically ($Z \rightarrow \ell^\pm \ell^\mp$ (OSSF lepton pair) ).
	\item \textbf{other}: Processes with a relatively minimal, but non-negligible background contribution in the \tWZ signal region 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item [-] \textbf{Triboson}: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item [] $WZZ \rightarrow \ell\ell\ell\ell\ell \nu$
		\item [] $ZZZ \rightarrow \ell \ell \ell\ell\ell\ell$
		\item [] $ZZZ \rightarrow \ell\ell\ell\ell\nu\nu$
		\item [] $WWZ \rightarrow \ell\ell\ell\ell\nu\nu$
	\end{itemize}
	\item [-] $\mathbf{tZq}$: Top quark in association with a $Z$-boson and another quark.
	 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Regions and Event Selection}
\label{sec:regionsAndEventSelection}

Summary table of event selection. Why chose ZZb and ttz region. 
\section{Machine Learning Techniques}
What tool did we use, how did we use it, parameters of bdt/nn, input variables/importance, conversion of event level bdt output (bdtscore) to variable for fitting. Used ROC curve integral as a proxy for how good bdt was doing.
