\section{The ATLAS Experiment}
Brief overview of history of ATLAS and CERN in general. State accomplishments (higgs discovery - completed list of SM particles). 
\subsection{Large Hadron Collider (LHC)}
Topology, parts of it.
\section{The ATLAS Detector}
\subsection{Coordinate System and Kinematics}
Physical dimensions, properties (mass). Coordinate system. Definition of $\Delta R$, $\eta$.\\\\
In the next subsections:\\
Where are different particles detected? How are they detected at each part of the detector? How well do the different parts detect the different particles and how do they take advantage of different particle properties each part wishes to detect in an engineering/physics perspective (e.g. why we WANT some particles to get detected at some parts of the detector and how we do this (by use of correct materials which interact specifically with those particles which we wish to measure and NOT with other particles))
