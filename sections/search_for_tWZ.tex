 
\section{Backgrounds}
Maybe remove subsections below...\\\\
Yields table, signal percentage, background percentage in each region (and each sample)


\subsection{$t\bar{t}Z$}
\subsection{$ZZ$}
\subsection{other}
\section{Control Plots}
Fit variables only. Why these variables were chosen (maybe provide separation plots or just the separation values of different variables). Comment on data/mc agreement.
\section{Post-Fit Plots}
Plots, yields. \\\\
Input into fitting procedure (systematics, normfactors, nuisance parameters , why these were chosen) $\rightarrow$ does this go in a previous section?\\\\
What did fit do? Explain results from push-pull (e.g. the fit constrained (had a constraining effect) x background uncertainty)
\section{Results}
Commentary on results, limit on $\sigma (\tWZ)$, within uncertainties of SM?
