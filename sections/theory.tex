\section{Standard Model of Particle Physics}
The Standard Model (SM) is a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which classifies all known elementary particles and describes their interactions. It is a well-tested model and has shown to be hugely successful in describing experimental data to great precision. It incorporates three of the four fundamental forces of nature: the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong forces. In Figure~\ref{fig:SM-particles}, all known elementary particles described by the SM, are shown.

\caption{A summary of the elementary particles decribed by the SM~\cite{SM-picture} is shown. Fermions are shown on the left, with quarks shown in purple and leptons shown in green. Bosons are shown on the right, with gauge bosons shown in red and the Higgs boson shown in yellow. The mass, electric charge and spin of each particle is shown on the top left of each particle's block.}
\label{fig:SM-particles}
\end{figure}
\noindent
SM particles are uniquely described by their quantum numbers: mass, electric charge and spin. The SM particles are split into main two classes, based off their spin quantum numbers. Particles which have half-integer spin are called fermions, and those which have integer spin are called bosons. Fermions are further divided into three generations, each comprising of two quarks, one charged lepton and one neutrino. The particles of each generation have identical electric charge and spin, but their masses differ. The masses of the particles in a generation increase with increasing generation number, with generation 1 particles being the least massive and generation 3 particles being the most massive. Quarks carry electric and colour charge, and can therefore interact via the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces. Colour charge can take on three values: red, green and blue. Due to colour confinement~\cite{quark-confinement}, quarks cannot be isolated from one another. They exist in colourless bound states, called hadrons, consisting of two or more quarks. Hadrons consisting of an even number of quarks are known as mesons and those consisting of an odd number of quarks are known as baryons. On the other hand, charged leptons (electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$) and tau ($\tau$)) only carry electric charge and can therefore interact electromagnetically and weakly, but not through the strong interaction. The electric and colour neutral fermions, neutrinos, can only interact via the weak force.\\\\
\noindent
Particles are able to interact with one-another via the exchange of a gauge boson (boson with spin-1). Photons are massless, spin-1 gauge bosons which mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles which carry electric charge, such as quarks and charged leptons ($e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$). The weak interaction is mediated by three massive gauge bosons, the electrically charged $W^{+}$ and $W^{-}$ bosons and the electrically neutral $Z$ boson. Gluons are massless, spin-1 gauge bosons which mediate strong interactions between particles which carry colour charge, such as quarks. Since gluons carry colour charge, they interact with themselves.\\\\
\noindent
The massive, spin-0, electrically neutral Higgs boson mediates the Higgs field which gives mass to the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons via the so-called Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism~\cite{PhysRevLett.13.321, Higgs:1966ev, Higgs:1964pj}. The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism induces spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking to provide mass terms for the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons in the electroweak Lagrangian of the SM.\\\\ 

%The strengths of each fundamental force in an interaction is determined by so-called coupling constants.  
\noindent
All particles described in the SM have their own antiparticle, with the same mass, but opposite charges. Some particles, such as the photon, are their own antiparticle.\\\\
\noindent
Although the SM has shown to be hugely successful, it is incomplete and fails to describe certain observed phenomena. *****MORE HERE****

\subsection{The Top Quark}
The top quark is the heaviest particle in the SM, with a mass of 172.76 $\pm$ 0.30 GeV~\cite{pdg}. Since the coupling to the Higgs boson is proportional the the mass of the interacting particle, the top quark is strongly coupled to the Higgs boson. Its large mass also makes it highly unstable, with a mean lifetime of $\approx 0.5 \times 10^{-24}$ s~\cite{pdg}. The top quark's lifetime is shorter than that of the hadronisation process, and it therefore decays before hadronising. We therefore cannot measure the top quark directly, but indirectly via its decay products. Top quarks almost always decay to a $W$ boson and a $b$-quark ($\frac{\Gamma(Wb)}{\Gamma( Wq (q=b,s,d))} = 0.957\pm 0.034$~\cite{pdg}). $b$-quarks are the second heaviest quark in the SM, however their lifetimes are still longer than the hadronisation time scale. In hadron collider experiments, $b$-quarks travel a short distance in the detector before hadronising to form jets. In Table~\ref{tab:top-decay-modes}, the dominant final state branching fractions of the top quark, are shown.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
decay mode & Branching Fraction ($\frac{\Gamma_{i}}{\Gamma}$)\\ \hline
$t \rightarrow Wb \rightarrow e\nu_{e} b$           &      $(11.10\pm 0.30)\%$     \\
$t \rightarrow Wb \rightarrow \mu \nu_{\mu} b$             &   $(11.40\pm 0.20)\%$        \\
       $t \rightarrow Wb \rightarrow \tau \nu_{\tau} b$      &  $(10.70\pm 0.50)\%$         \\
  $t \rightarrow Wb\rightarrow q\bar{q} b$           &      $(66.50\pm 1.40)\%$     \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\centering
\caption{The dominant final state branching fractions of the top quark~\cite{pdg} are shown.}
\label{tab:top-decay-modes}
\end{table}

\noindent
Hadronic final states are more than twice as likely than leptonic final states. Final state decays to different lepton flavours are roughly equally probable.\\\\
Top quark production can be placed into two main categories: pair production ($t\bar{t}$) and single-top production ($t$). In the LHC, top quarks are mainly produced in pairs via strong interactions in gluon-gluon fusion ($gg\rightarrow t\bar{t}$) or quark annihilation ($q\bar{q}\rightarrow t\bar{t}$). Top quark production via gluon-gluon fusion is the dominating process, since gluons are the most dominant particles produced in $pp$ collisions in the LHC. The most abundant mechanisms leading to single top production include, those involving the exchange of a $W$ boson and those involving the production of a top quark in association with a $W$ boson. In Table~\ref{tab:single-top-crossSection}, single top production cross sections in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV for various channels, are shown.


\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
Process & Total cross section [pb] \\ \hline
$bq'\rightarrow W^{+} \rightarrow tq$ &  \\
 $q\bar{q'}\rightarrow   W^{+} \rightarrow \bar{b}t$&  \\
$bg \rightarrow  b/t \rightarrow Wt$ &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Backgrounds}
The main backgrounds for \tWZ (tetra-lepton channel) are the production of a two tops, both in the $\ell \nu b$ final state channel, together with a $Z$ boson (\ttZ) and diboson production with fully leptonic final states (\ZZ).

\ttZ contains fours leptons and two $b$-quarks in its final state (inclusive $\sigma(t\bar{t}Z)= 0.95 \pm 0.08_{\text{stat}} \pm 0.10_{syst}$pb at $\sqrt{s}=13$TeV~\cite{ttz-xsec-paper}) and can easily mimic the \tWZ signal process, for instance, by one of its $b$-jets getting missed during detection. \ZZ contains four leptons and zero $b$-quarks in its final state (inclusive $\sigma(ZZ)= 14.6^{+1.9}_{-1.8}(\text{stat})^{+0.5}_{-0.3}(\text{syst})\pm 0.2 (\text{theo})\pm 0.4 (\text{lumi})$pb at $\sqrt{s}=13$TeV ~\cite{zz-xsec-paper}). One way in which \ZZ can mimic the \tWZ signal process is by reconstruction of a non-prompt $b$-jet. 



\subsection{Comparison to Tri-lepton Channel}

%Less backgrounds to deal with (in tetralepton). However lower stats (in tetra). Give cross sections (and feynman diagram). Maybe talk a bit about analysis related challenges (trilepton has a hadronically decaying W, does this make the analysis easier or more difficult?).

The most apparent difference between the tri and tetra-lepton channels is the amount of statistics present, with the tetra-lepton channel having far less events in its phase space than that of the tri-lepton channel. The lack of statistics in the tetra-lepton channel can be attributed to its low production cross section, $\sigma^{\text{NLO}}_{(tW^{\pm}Z).Br(4\ell)} = \SI{0.7}{fb}$\cite{twz_3_lep}. The tri-lepton channel has a production cross section ($\sigma^{\text{NLO}}_{(tW^{\pm}Z).Br(3\ell)} = \SI{3.9}{fb}$\cite{twz_3_lep}) around a factor of 4 larger than that of the tetra-lepton channel. This difference between the production cross section of the two decay channels can be largely attributed to the difference in branching ratios ($\frac{\Gamma_i}{\Gamma}$) between a hadronically decaying $W$ boson, $\frac{\Gamma_{W \rightarrow had}}{\Gamma_W} = (67.41 \pm 0.27) \%$\cite{pdg}, present in the tri-lepton channel and a leptonically decaying $W$ boson, $\frac{\Gamma_{W \rightarrow \ell^{\+} \nu}}{\Gamma_W}  = (10.86 \pm 0.09) \%$\cite{pdg}, present in the tetra-lepton channel.\\\\
Despite the tetralepton channel's low statistics, it is not subject to the large $WZ$ background present in the trilepton channel. The tetralepton channel has a relatively large $ZZ$ background (not present in the trilepton channel), fortunately this can be easily suppressed due to the full reconstructability of the two leptonically decaying $Z$-bosons.
