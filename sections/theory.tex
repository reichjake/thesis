\section{Standard Model of Particle Physics}
What is SM (renormalisable qft), come from symmetry, brief description of group structure? Explain structure/properties (fermions, bosons, etc.), coupling constants. 'Particles carry color/electric charge, some particles can interact with others/themselves, some can't' Where does it how? How well does it work? Where doesn't it work? 
\subsection{Electroweak Theory}
Properties of W and Z. Decay channels. Z as the standard candle (distinct OSSF lepton signal).
\subsection{Top Quark}
Properties. History (when/how was it discovered/theorised). Why interesting (large mass). Hierarchy problem. Decay channels. Extremely short lifetime (makes b's so important for top ID).
\section{$tWZ$}
\subsection{Tetra-lepton Channel}
Provide feynman diagram. Cross section. 

\subsection{Comparison to Tri-lepton Channel}

Less backgrounds to deal with (in tetralepton). However lower stats (in tetra). Give cross sections (and feynman diagram). Maybe talk a bit about analysis related challenges (trilepton has a hadronically decaying W, does this make the analysis easier or more difficult?).
